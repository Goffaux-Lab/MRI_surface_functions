<img align="right" width="50%" src="/images/done.gif">

And here is some text:
To resize your image, simply set width="30%", or whatever percent you'd like
between 0% and 100%, to get the desired effect! This is much easier than trying
to set a pixel size, such as width="200" height="150", as using a width percent
automatically adjusts to your viewer's screen and to the page display width,
and it automatically resizes the image as you resize your browser window as
well. It also avoids skewing the image into unnatural proportions. It's a great
feature!
